# Revisiting Arrays and Slices with Generics

This doesn't feel idiomatic?

Try to have an open-mind.

Whilst the idioms of Go won't, and shouldn't radically change due to generics being released, the idioms will change - due to the language changing! This should not be a controversial point.

Saying

> This is not idiomatic

Without any more detail, is not an actionable, or useful thing to say. Especially when discussing new language features.

Discuss with your colleagues patterns and style of code based on their merits rather than dogma. So long as you have well-designed tests, you'll always be able to refactor and shift things as you understand what works well for you, and your team.
