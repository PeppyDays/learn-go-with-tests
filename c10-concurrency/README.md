## Basic

- Use Goroutine
- Use benchmark test
- Use channel to help organize and control the communication between the different processes and avoid race condition

## Premature Optimization

Summarised from [Premature Optimization](http://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization).

> Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.
